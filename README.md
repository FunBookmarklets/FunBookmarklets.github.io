# Fun Bookmarklets
Welcome to Fun Bookmarklets! We provide bookmarklets that can be used for some fun. If you want us to add yours fork this repository and then add it on your fork. After that open a pull request here. We have a guide on how to add your own.

Please note that we took a lot of the base code from [Scratch Bookmarklets](https://github.com/Scratch-Bookmarklets/Scratch-Bookmarklets.github.io) with our owner owning that as well.
